\extrachap{Acknowledgements}

The writing of this book was made possible by Balasubramanian Ananthanarayan, who encouraged to take up this endeavour. My knowledge in the area of non-Fermi liquids can mainly be attributed to my association with Sung-Sik Lee, when I joined Perimeter Institute as a Postdoctoral Scholar. I am indebted to him for teaching the nitty-gritty details of the quantum-field-theory (QFT) formulation of such non-relativistic systems. I express my gratitude to my collaborators for various works published on this topic, which include Subir Sachdev, Matthias Punk, Rafael M. Fernandes, Hermann Freire, Kazi Ranjibul Islam, Dimitri Pimenov, and Francesco Piazza. Lastly, I want to express my endless thanks to my PhD supervisor and teacher, Ashoke Sen, from whom I learnt the basics of QFT in the first place.
